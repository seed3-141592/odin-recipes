    <P>Humba is a dish popular in the southern parts of the Philippines â€“ the Visayas and most part of Mindanao. Reason why sometimes it is referred to as Adobong Bisaya.
        The dish resembles adobo in appearance but the taste is on the sweeter side because of the addition of sugar.</P>

    <h2>
        Pork Humba Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds pork belly sliced into larged pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup of pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1 larged onion-chopped</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon fermented black beans (tausi)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 pieces dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorn</li>
        <li>1 peice star anise</li>
        <li>dried banana blossoms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place all ingredients in a pot. Cook until meat is tender, lowering heat to simmer. Remove scum that rises to the top.</li>
        <li>(Depending on your preference you can cook until dry and then brown the meat in its own rendered fat).</li>
        <li>
            My family likes plenty adobo sauce so I did not completely reduce the liquid. I transferred the pork pieces in an oven-safe dish and browned them in the oven for 20 minutes or you can brown them in a frying pan. Make sure to toast the skin side down the pan. I then returned the meat to the sauce. Serve and enjoy!
